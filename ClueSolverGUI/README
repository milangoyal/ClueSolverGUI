This Java program contains the graphic user interface for the ClueSolver program. More information can be found on the ClueSolver
GitHub: https://github.com/milangoyal/ClueSolver

Requires ClueSolver jar which is already included in repository under lib.

1. Compile WCSPLift (The README file contains instructions). GitHub: https://gitlab.com/xuphys/wcsp-solver

2. Copy the Top K Solutions Generator repository. GitHub: https://gitlab.com/kianasun/top-k-wcsp-solutions
This step is optional but necessary if you would like to output the top K solutions to the Clue game rather
than just the top solution.

3. Export this repository as a runnable JAR (Main is in Main.java). Run the JAR and input the absolute file path
to the WCSPLift Binary executable as well as the file path for the main.py of the top K solutions generator. Skipping
either of these step will not result in an error but you will not have access to the corresponding functionality.

NOTE: Running the script to produce alternative solutions may take several seconds, especially when a large number of
alternative solutions are selected or there are a very large number of players. During this time, the program will appear
frozen, but just let finish executing the necessary Python script (the program will automatically kill the attempt if 
it takes longer than a certain threshold). The solver works best for up to 5 players and 3 or less alternative solutions.
